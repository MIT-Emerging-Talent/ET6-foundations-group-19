## Meet The Team 🌟

- Ahmed Khalifa: A second-rate meme lord, but a first-class code reviewer.
  No detail escapes his eye, and no cricket
  goes unacknowledged when he drops a punchline. 🔎

- Dadi Ishimwe: Or Daddy, the Rwandan that can do basically anything
  (many people told him to change his name). 🎯
  
- Mahmoud Alnouri: THE supreme Data Analyst, master of spreadsheets and
  high priest of tables, at your service. 📈

- Mohammad R. Al Salloum: Coding is his first language. Says “I bend electrons”,
  sounds so cool (probably bending him back now). ⚡

- Mukuna Kabeya (aka Paul): One name is cool, two names are legendary -
  Mukuna/Paul choose what you want. 🕶️

- Raed Eleyan: THE Expert, He thinks he's just a bro, but he's actually a pro.
  That's why his name means 'pioneer' in Arabic. 🏆

- Rama Arafeh: THE keen biologist who never uses GUI, but she would steal your DNA
  sample and plant it at a crime scene without you noticing. 🧬

- Tamara Saqer: A first-rate meme queen, her creativity is out of this world.
  If she earned a dollar for every meme she created, she would be a multimillionaire. 💰

## Let's design something extraordinary together. 😎
