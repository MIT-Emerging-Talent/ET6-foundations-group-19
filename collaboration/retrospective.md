# Retrospective

## Stop Doing
  1) Skipping documentation of processes and branch naming conventions.
  2) Assuming everyone knows Git commands without providing guidance or training.
     
## Continue Doing
  1) Use the Project Management Board
  2) Document issues using the issues module

## Start Doing
  1) Scheduling periodic reviews of pull requests to ensure code quality and knowledge sharing.
  2) Documenting best practices for writing commit messages and creating branches.
  3) Providing training or cheat sheets on Git commands and GitHub usage.
     
## Lessons Learned
  1) Clear communication and agreed-upon workflows are crucial when using Git for collaboration.
  2) Setting up a structure in GitHub, like repositories and access permissions, early on saves time.
  3) Miscommunication about Git workflows can lead to merge conflicts or work duplication.
  4) Regular practice is essential for the team to get comfortable with Git commands.

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?
  1) Successfully joined the GitHub repository and onboarded all team members.

### What parts of your plan did not work out?
  1) Finish all reviews in the expected time, some reviews need more time than initailly expected.
  2) Difficulty in understanding the GitHub interface and its features by New team members. 

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?
Yes, we added a few meeting sessions for the team on resolving conflicts and for helping new-to-Git team members.

### Or remove extra steps?
